/*
  This function performs an update on the `tbl` field of the `census.sf1_temp` table.

  The update is designed to correct or standardize the values in the `tbl` field 
  by aligning them with the corresponding `field_code` values from the `census.dd_seq_dhc` table. 
  The `tbl` field in `census.sf1_temp` is intended to store specific code values that relate to 
  segments of census data, and this function ensures that these codes are accurate and up-to-date.

  The function operates as follows:
  
  1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
     - The function begins by defining two CTEs:
       a. `indexed_dd`: This CTE organizes data from the `census.dd_seq_dhc` table by creating a 
          row index for each combination of `segment`, `tbl`, and `field_code`. The `ROW_NUMBER()` 
          function is used to assign a unique index position within each partition of `segment` and `tbl`.
       b. `to_update`: This CTE identifies rows in `census.sf1_temp` that require updates. It joins the 
          `census.sf1_temp` table with the `indexed_dd` CTE on matching segments and tables, ensuring 
          that only rows where the `tbl` field is currently incorrect (i.e., it does not match the `field_code`) 
          are selected for update.

  2. **Update Operation:**
     - The main update operation takes place in the `UPDATE` statement. It updates the `tbl` field in 
       `census.sf1_temp` for the selected rows, setting it to the correct `field_code` value retrieved 
       from the `to_update` CTE. This ensures that the `tbl` field accurately reflects the intended data 
       structure, according to the reference data in `census.dd_seq_dhc`.

  3. **Batch Processing:**
     - The function processes updates in batches, as determined by the `batch_size_param`. This approach 
       limits the number of rows updated in a single transaction, which helps to manage system resources 
       and minimize potential locking and I/O contention within the database. Batch processing is particularly 
       useful when dealing with large datasets, as it allows for more controlled and incremental updates.

  4. **Performance Considerations:**
     - To further optimize performance, the function can be run in parallel across different states by 
       specifying a `state_param` value. This parallel execution reduces the time required to update large 
       datasets by distributing the workload and avoiding bottlenecks on specific rows or segments.
     - The function also captures the start and end times of the update operation to calculate and return the 
       elapsed time for each batch. This information is useful for monitoring performance and optimizing 
       batch sizes for future runs.

  5. **Return Values:**
     - Upon completion of each batch, the function returns a summary of the operation, including:
       a. The state processed (`state_param`).
       b. The last processed `logrecno` value, allowing for sequential processing in subsequent runs.
       c. The number of rows updated in the batch (`updated_count`).
       d. The time taken to process the batch (`elapsed_time`), providing insight into the function's efficiency.

  This function is intended to be used as part of a larger data maintenance or data cleansing operation, 
  ensuring that the `census.sf1_temp` table remains consistent and accurate in its representation of census 
  data. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the `tbl` field's accuracy is critical for downstream 
  processing, analysis, or reporting.

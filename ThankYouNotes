Dear Neurotech Exchange Members,

I hope this message finds you all well and in a positive frame of mind. I wanted to sincerely thank you all for the amazing adventure we've experienced over the past three years as we come together one more time. I sincerely thank each and every one of you for this amazing and incredibly rewarding experience.

After a demanding workday, our Friday night conversations turned into a much-loved ritual when we got together to discuss the exciting field of neurotech. These discussions were made much more memorable by your commitment to attending and actively participating in them.

I would want to express my sincere gratitude to each and every presenter, both inside and outside of BAH, for kindly sharing their expertise and views. Your efforts have been crucial in building a lively and educational community where we can all learn and develop.

Now, after 15.5 years of amazing experiences and possibilities, I'm getting ready to say goodbye to Booz Allen Hamilton, but rest assured that the Neurotech Exchange will go on. In the following year, a new presenter will be taking over and extending invitations for the sessions that are coming up. Under new leadership, I'm sure the Neurotech Exchange will continue to be a center for innovation, cooperation, and learning.

Starting this community has been an honor and a privilege, and as I start a new chapter in my career, I will take the memories of our conversations and our discoveries with me.

I want to thank you again for all of your wisdom, friendship, and inspiration throughout our time together. Please keep up the good work and investigate the fascinating areas of neurotechnology.

I hope you succeed in everything you do, and I'm interested in learning about the Neurotech Exchange's future developments.

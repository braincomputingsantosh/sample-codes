1. Lead Team: A new Fair Lending team option is now available.

2. Fair Lending Type: Two options are now available (no changes needed).

3. Fair Lending Focus: This item has five options now:
   - ECOA IPL
   - ECOA Baseline
   - ECOA Race/Ethnicity
   - HMDA Data Integrity
   - HMDA CRA

For item 3, Fair Lending Focus, I can suggest the following field names:

1. fair_lending_focus_ecoa_ipl
2. fair_lending_focus_ecoa_baseline
3. fair_lending_focus_ecoa_race_ethnicity
4. fair_lending_focus_hmda_data_integrity
5. fair_lending_focus_hmda_cra

These field names follow a consistent naming convention, starting with the category (fair_lending_focus) followed by the specific option, using underscores to separate words and all lowercase letters. This style is commonly used in database field naming conventions.

The message also notes that these changes are for the front end of SES (likely a system name) and that some staging tables need to be updated. It mentions that while field IDs exist in sv3_rpt.exams, the field names don't need to be updated on the back-end due to the use of an Alias in SQL.

Finally, it states that the "Fair Lending Focus" field needs to be added to sv3_rpt.exams to access the new field that currently only exists on the SV3 front end.

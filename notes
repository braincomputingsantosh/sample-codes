To get a Databricks personal access token (PAT), you need to generate it from the Databricks workspace. A PAT is used for authentication when you are interfacing with Databricks through APIs, Databricks Connect, or other third-party tools. Here’s how you can generate a personal access token in Databricks:

For Databricks on AWS or GCP:
Log into your Databricks workspace.

Click on the User Icon in the top right corner of the workspace.

Select "User Settings" from the dropdown menu.

Navigate to the "Access Tokens" tab.

Click on the "Generate New Token" button.

Provide a description for the token (for your reference to identify the purpose of the token later).

Set a lifespan for the token. This is the duration for which the token will be valid. Choose this based on your requirement, but be aware that a longer lifespan can pose a security risk if the token is compromised.

Click on the "Generate" button.

Copy the generated token and save it securely. This is important as you will not be able to view the token again once you close this window.

For Databricks on Azure (Azure Databricks):
Log into your Azure Databricks workspace.

Click on the "Settings" icon (looks like a gear) in the lower-left corner of the workspace.

Go to "User Settings".

In the “Access Tokens” section, click on “Generate New Token”.

Add a comment for your reference and choose the token’s lifespan.

Click “Generate” and then copy and securely store the token.

Security Tips:
Keep the Token Secure: Treat your access token like a password. Store it securely and never share it in plaintext or check it into version control systems.
Limited Lifespan: It's generally a good practice to set a reasonable expiry for the token. If you believe a token has been compromised or is no longer needed, revoke it immediately.
Use Environment Variables: When using the token in applications or scripts, it's best to set it as an environment variable instead of hard-coding it into your programs.
Using the Token:
Once you have the token, you can use it for authentications, such as setting up Databricks Connect, API calls, or any other integrations that require Databricks access. Remember, the token provides access based on your user permissions, so handle it with the same level of security as your Databricks account credentials.

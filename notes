## GPRA Date Calculation

The GPRA (Government Performance and Results Act) date calculation is a crucial component in our examination process tracking system. It serves to:

1. Automate the determination of key deadline dates for examination reports.
2. Ensure compliance with regulatory timeframes for report submissions.
3. Account for workdays, excluding weekends and holidays, in the calculation.

The calculation logic:
- Starts from the 'Exam Analysis Finalized' date.
- Adds 45 workdays if no 'Draft to Prudential' date is set.
- Considers weekends and holidays as non-workdays.
- Resets to null if both 'Exam Analysis Finalized' and 'Draft to Prudential' dates are set.

This automated process enhances accuracy in deadline tracking, supports efficient workflow management, and aids in maintaining regulatory compliance in our examination procedures.

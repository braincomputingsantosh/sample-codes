Calculating "stat" from SF1 (Summary File 1) data typically involves several steps. Here's a general approach:

Identify the table and variables:
SF1 data is organized into numerous tables, each with specific variables. Identify which table and variables you need for your statistic.
Understand the data structure:
SF1 data is often stored in a hierarchical structure, with geographic identifiers and data values.
Extract relevant data:
Use SQL queries or data processing tools to extract the specific variables you need.
Perform calculations:
Depending on the statistic you're aiming for, you might need to:

Sum values across certain geographies
Calculate percentages or rates
Combine multiple variables


Apply appropriate filters:
Ensure you're working with the correct geographic level (e.g., tract, county, state)

Here's a basic example in SQL:


SELECT 
    geo.geoid,
    geo.tract,
    sf1.P001001 as total_population
FROM 
    census.geo_sf_2010 as geo
JOIN 
    census.sf1 as sf1 ON geo.logrecno = sf1.logrecno
WHERE 
    geo.sumlevel = '140'  -- Tract level
    AND sf1.table_id = 'P1'  -- Total population table

This query would give you the total population (stat) for each census tract.
For more complex statistics, you might need to:

Join multiple tables
Use aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, etc.)
Calculate derived values

For example, to calculate the percentage of a specific demographic:

SELECT 
    geo.geoid,
    geo.tract,
    sf1.P001001 as total_population,
    sf1.P003003 as white_alone,
    (sf1.P003003 * 100.0 / sf1.P001001) as percent_white
FROM 
    census.geo_sf_2010 as geo
JOIN 
    census.sf1 as sf1 ON geo.logrecno = sf1.logrecno
WHERE 
    geo.sumlevel = '140'

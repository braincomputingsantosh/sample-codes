Identifying Vulnerable Populations:  SVI helps pinpoint communities more susceptible to predatory lending practices, debt collection issues, or difficulty managing finances due to social factors like limited transportation or language barriers.

Targeted Outreach and Education:  By understanding areas of high social vulnerability and low financial literacy, the CFPB can tailor consumer education initiatives, reaching those most at risk.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation:  Integrating SVI data into your existing risk assessment models can help identify potential hotspots for financial exploitation, allowing for proactive measures to protect consumers.

Promoting Financial Inclusion:  By understanding social vulnerabilities that hinder financial well-being, the CFPB can advocate for policies promoting access to safe and affordable financial products for all.

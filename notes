Certainly! Here's a document on how to execute the provided YAML file named `data_load_acs_data.yaml`:

# Executing data_load_acs_data.yaml

The `data_load_acs_data.yaml` file contains configuration settings for loading and processing ACS (American Community Survey) data. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to execute this YAML file using Python:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the `PyYAML` library by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install pyyaml
     ```

2. Create a Python script (e.g., `load_acs_data.py`) and add the following code:
   ```python
   import yaml
   from custom_logic import log_file_size, generate_checksum
   from plugin_scripts.import_geo import import_geo

   def load_acs_data(config):
       # Access configuration settings
       path = config['path']
       write_path = config['write_path']
       project_name = config['project_name']
       schema_name = config['scheman_name']
       reprocess = config['reprocess']

       # Execute process_logic for all files
       for logic in config['process_logic']:
           if logic['logic'] == 'custom_logic.log_file_size':
               log_file_size()
           elif logic['logic'] == 'custom_logic.generate_checksum':
               generate_checksum()

       # Process mapping
       for mapping in config['mapping']:
           file_regex = mapping['file_regex']
           file_type = mapping['file_type']
           file_encoding = mapping['file_encoding']
           column_list = mapping['column_list']

           # Execute process_logic for each mapping
           for logic in mapping['process_logic']:
               if logic['logic'] == 'custom_logic:count_file_linux_wc':
                   # Implement count_file_linux_wc logic here
                   pass
               elif 'plugin' in logic:
                   plugin_script = logic['plugin']
                   if plugin_script == 'plugin_scripts/import_geo.py':
                       import_geo()

   # Load the YAML file
   with open('data_load_acs_data.yaml', 'r') as file:
       config = yaml.safe_load(file)

   # Execute the loading process
   load_acs_data(config)
   ```

3. Implement the required logic:
   - Create a `custom_logic.py` file and implement the `log_file_size()` and `generate_checksum()` functions according to your specific requirements.
   - Create a `plugin_scripts` directory and add the `import_geo.py` file. Implement the `import_geo()` function in this file based on your needs.

4. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python load_acs_data.py
   ```

   The script will load the `data_load_acs_data.yaml` file, parse its contents, and execute the defined loading and processing steps.

The YAML file contains the following configuration settings:
- `path`: The source path for the ACS data.
- `write_path`: The destination path where the processed data will be written.
- `project_name`: The name of the project.
- `scheman_name`: The name of the schema.
- `reprocess`: A flag indicating whether to reprocess the data.
- `process_logic`: A list of logic steps to be executed for all files.
- `mapping`: A list of file mappings, each specifying the file regex, file type, file encoding, column list, and process logic.

The script loads the YAML file, accesses the configuration settings, and executes the defined process logic and file mappings. It calls the respective functions from the `custom_logic.py` file and the `import_geo()` function from the `import_geo.py` plugin script based on the specified logic.

Make sure to implement the required functions in the `custom_logic.py` file and the `import_geo.py` plugin script according to your specific data loading and processing requirements.

Note: The provided code assumes the existence of certain functions and files. Make sure to create and implement them based on your specific needs.

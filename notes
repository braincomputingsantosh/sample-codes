Here's a documentation of the key parts of the Python script related to aborting if a duplicate file is found:

1. The script defines a `custom_logic` function that checks if a file has already been processed.

2. It queries a database table (likely `logging.meta_source_files`) to check if a file with matching criteria already exists and has been processed.

3. If a matching processed file is found, the `already_processed` flag is set to True.

4. When `already_processed` is True, the function:
   - Logs an error message: "Duplicate File Found"
   - Sets `continue_processing` to False

5. The function returns `continue_processing`, which will be False if a duplicate is found, likely causing the calling code to abort further processing.

6. There's a commented out line to raise an exception, which could be uncommented to forcefully abort the process instead of just returning a flag.

This approach allows the script to detect duplicate files and prevent their reprocessing, helping to maintain data integrity and avoid redundant operations.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?

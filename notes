HELOC Data Append and Update Source

This script performs the following operations:
1. Updates source metadata for HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) data.
2. Appends and updates records in a target table (likely a 'silver' table in a data lake architecture).
3. Handles data processing for raw and silver tables, including:
   - Reading data from a raw table
   - Checking for existing data in the silver table
   - Appending new data or updating existing records
   - Updating file metadata (e.g., file path, process date, status)
4. Implements error handling and logging for the data processing pipeline
5. Executes data processing for specific time periods (as_of_month)

The script uses PySpark for data manipulation and is designed to work with
large-scale data processing in a distributed computing environment.

Key functions:
- update_source_metadata: Updates metadata for the source files
- extract_file_info: Extracts information from file paths
- append_and_update_metadata: Main function for appending and updating data
- process_table: Processes tables based on specified parameters

This code is part of a data pipeline for managing and updating HELOC data,
likely in a financial or banking context.

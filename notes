I'm writing to provide an update on our recent database enhancements regarding exceptional days:

Helper Table Creation:
We have successfully created a helper table called 'exceptional_days' to manage ad hoc dates.
New Functions:
Two new functions have been implemented:
a) add_exceptional_day: Allows adding a new exceptional day
Example: SELECT sv3_rpt.add_exceptional_day('2022-07-04', 'Special Conference Day');
b) remove_exceptional_day: Enables removal of an exceptional day
Example: SELECT sv3_rpt.remove_exceptional_day('2021-04-15');
Supporting CTE Query:
We've developed a Common Table Expression (CTE) query that combines:

Newly added ad hoc dates from the exceptional_days table
Additional dates from the original date dimension table

This query creates a comprehensive view of all relevant dates, including:

Regular holidays from sv3_ses.date_dimension
Custom exceptional days from sv3_rpt.exceptional_days

The final result is ordered by date_value for easy reference.

These enhancements provide greater flexibility in managing exceptional days while maintaining integration with our existing date-related data.
If you need any further clarification or have questions about using these new features, please don't hesitate to reach out.

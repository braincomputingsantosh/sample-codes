Basics of Temp Tables in Databricks:

Temp tables in Databricks are similar to temporary tables in traditional relational databases.
They are session-scoped, meaning they exist only for the duration of the Spark session.
Created using the syntax: CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...


Types of Temporary Views:

Session-scoped temporary views: Visible only within the current session.
Global temporary views: Visible across all sessions in a Spark application, created with CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW.


Differences from Traditional RDBMS Temp Tables:

Storage: In-memory or disk-based depending on size and configuration.
Indexing: No built-in indexing support.
Query Optimization: Uses Catalyst Optimizer instead of traditional cost-based optimizers.
Distribution: Can be distributed across a cluster.


Use Cases:

Intermediate data processing steps in complex queries.
Reusing result sets within a session.
Simplifying complex ETL processes.


Limitations:

No support for explicit indexes.
Cannot be used for long-term data storage.
Limited by session/application lifecycle.


Performance Considerations:

Caching: Can be explicitly cached for faster access.
Partitioning: Supports partitioning for large datasets.


Advanced Topics:
a. Delta Lake Integration:

Temp views can be created from Delta tables.
Can be used in conjunction with Delta Lake operations.

b. Streaming with Temp Views:

Can be used in Structured Streaming queries.
Useful for transformations in streaming pipelines.

c. Schema Evolution:

Temp views reflect the current schema of the underlying data.
Changes to source data schema are immediately reflected.

d. Security and Access Control:

Temp views inherit the security settings of the underlying data.
Not shareable between different users' sessions.

e. Upsert Operations:

Can be used as intermediaries in complex upsert operations.
Useful for staging data before merging into Delta tables.


Best Practices:

Use for intermediate computations, not for long-term storage.
Consider caching for frequently accessed temp views.
Drop temp views when no longer needed to free up resources.
Be mindful of the session lifecycle when using temp views.


Databricks-Specific Features:

Integration with Databricks notebooks and jobs.
Can be used seamlessly with various Databricks runtimes.


Comparison with Permanent Tables:

Temp tables are more ephemeral and suitable for transient operations.
Permanent tables are better for persistent storage and cross-session data sharing.


Advanced Use Case: Streaming Upserts

Demonstrated using temp views as part of a streaming upsert pipeline.
Showed how to handle schema mismatches and perform efficient merges.


Performance Tuning:

Discussed strategies for optimizing upsert operations using temp views.
Covered topics like batch size control and schema alignment.


Error Handling and Resilience:

Explored techniques for making streaming jobs with temp views more robust.
Implemented retry mechanisms and proper error logging.


Monitoring and Observability:

Discussed ways to log and monitor temp view usage in streaming jobs.
Implemented timing mechanisms to track performance.

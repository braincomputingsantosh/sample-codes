Requirements Document: HELOC Data Processing and Metadata Management System

1. System Overview
   The system is designed to process Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) data, 
   moving it from raw to silver tables and managing associated metadata. It 
   operates on specific time periods and updates source metadata after processing.

2. Functional Requirements

   2.1 Data Selection
       - The system shall query for specific time periods (as_of_month) to 
         identify datasets for processing.
       - It shall generate a list of datasets that need to be imported from 
         raw to silver tables based on the as_of_month query.

   2.2 Data Processing
       - The system shall read data from the identified raw tables.
       - It shall check for existing data in the silver table for the given 
         as_of_month.
       - If data doesn't exist in the silver table, the system shall append 
         new data.
       - If data exists, the system shall update the existing records.

   2.3 Metadata Management
       - After successful data processing, the system shall update the 
         source_metadata table with details of the update.
       - Metadata updates shall include:
         * File name
         * File path
         * Process date
         * File type
         * File insert date
         * Process state (e.g., "PROCESSED", "FAILED")
         * Rows inserted count
         * Error messages (if any)
         * Reprocess flag

   2.4 Error Handling
       - The system shall catch and log any errors occurring during the 
         data processing.
       - In case of errors, it shall update the metadata with error 
         information, including a truncated error message.

3. Technical Requirements

   3.1 Platform
       - The system shall use PySpark for data processing and manipulation.

   3.2 Data Structures
       - Raw tables: Store the initial, unprocessed HELOC data.
       - Silver tables: Store the processed and cleaned HELOC data.
       - Metadata table: Store metadata about the processing of each file.

   3.3 Functions
       - update_source_metadata(): Update metadata for processed files.
       - extract_file_info(): Extract relevant information from file paths.
       - append_and_update_metadata(): Main function for data processing and 
         metadata updates.
       - process_table(): Orchestrate the processing of tables for specific 
         time periods.

4. Performance Requirements
   - The system shall be capable of handling large-scale data processing in 
     a distributed computing environment.

5. Security Requirements
   - Implement appropriate access controls for raw, silver, and metadata tables.
   - Ensure secure handling of potentially sensitive HELOC data.

6. Maintainability and Scalability
   - The code shall be well-documented with function-level comments.
   - The system should be designed to accommodate potential increases in 
     data volume and processing frequency.

7. Reporting
   - The system shall log the results of each processing run, including 
     the number of rows inserted and any errors encountered.

8. Compliance
   - Ensure all data handling complies with relevant financial regulations 
     and data protection laws.

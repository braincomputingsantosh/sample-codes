It imports necessary modules for logging, file operations, and database interactions.
It sets up logging at the DEBUG level.
The custom_logic function:

Processes input from a database connection (db), a file of interest (foi), and a dataframe (df).
Extracts metadata like table name, schema, and file paths.
Calculates the file size and converts it to megabytes.
Logs the file size.
Updates a database table with the file size using a custom SQL query.
Raises an error if no rows were updated.


The process function:

Acts as a wrapper for custom_logic.
Performs input validation to ensure foi is an instance of FilesOfInterest and db is a database connection.
Calls custom_logic with the validated inputs.



Regarding running this in Databricks:
Yes, you could potentially run this code in Databricks, but with some considerations:

Databricks uses a distributed file system (DBFS), so the file path operations might need adjustment.
The database connection (db) would need to be set up appropriately for your Databricks environment. Databricks supports various database connections, so you'd need to ensure it's compatible with the db_utils being used here.
The custom modules like data_file_mgmt and migrate_utils would need to be available in your Databricks environment, either by installing them or including their code in your workspace.
You might need to adjust the logging configuration to work with Databricks' logging system.
The file size calculation might need modification if you're working with distributed files in Databricks.

To run this in Databricks, you'd likely need to:

Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
Adjust file paths to work with DBFS.
Set up appropriate database connections.
Possibly modify some functions to work in a distributed environment.
Incorporate this into a larger Databricks notebook or job structure.

Here's a simple outline of the workflow:

```
+------------------------+
|  data_load_acs_data.yaml  |
+------------------------+
            |
            |
            v
+------------------------+
|      Makefile          |
+------------------------+
            |
            |
            v
+------------------------+
|   load_acs_data.py     |
+------------------------+
            |
            |
            v
+------------------------+
|    custom_logic.py     |
+------------------------+
            |
            |
            v
+------------------------+
|   plugin_scripts/      |
|     import_geo.py      |
+------------------------+
```

The workflow can be described as follows:

1. The `data_load_acs_data.yaml` file contains the configuration settings for loading and processing the ACS data.

2. The `Makefile` is created to automate the execution of the Python script `load_acs_data.py` with the specified YAML file.

3. The `load_acs_data.py` script is responsible for loading the YAML file, parsing its contents, and executing the defined loading and processing steps.

4. The `custom_logic.py` file contains the implementation of the `log_file_size()` and `generate_checksum()` functions, which are referenced in the YAML file and used by the `load_acs_data.py` script.

5. The `plugin_scripts` directory contains the `import_geo.py` file, which implements the `import_geo()` function referenced in the YAML file and used by the `load_acs_data.py` script.

The workflow starts with the `data_load_acs_data.yaml` file, which is used by the `Makefile` to trigger the execution of the `load_acs_data.py` script. The script loads the YAML file, parses its contents, and executes the defined loading and processing steps. It utilizes the functions implemented in the `custom_logic.py` file and the `import_geo.py` plugin script based on the configuration specified in the YAML file.

I hope this textual representation helps clarify the workflow. Let me know if you have any further questions!

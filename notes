It sets up logging and imports necessary modules for database operations, file management, and migration utilities.
The custom_logic function is the core of the processing:

It takes a database connection (db), a file of interest (foi), and a dataframe (df) as inputs.
It extracts metadata from these inputs, such as table name, schema, and file path.
It checks if a checksum (CRC) already exists for a given file in the database.
If the checksum doesn't exist, it generates a new one using migrate_utils.static_func.md5_file.
It then updates the database with the new checksum using a custom SQL query.
If the update affects no rows, it raises a ValueError.


The process function acts as a wrapper:

It performs some input validation, ensuring foi is an instance of FilesOfInterest and db is a database connection.
It then calls the custom_logic function with the validated inputs.


The code uses a custom SQL query (update_sql) for updating logging metadata, which is commented as being faster than using a framework wrapper.
There's error handling and logging throughout the process to track the execution flow and any issues that arise.

| Feature | Databricks Temp Table | RDBMS Temp Table |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Session-scoped (temporary view) or application-scoped (global temporary view) | Session-scoped or transaction-scoped |
| Storage | In-memory or disk-based, depending on size and configuration | Usually memory-based, can spill to disk |
| Indexing | No built-in indexing | Supports creation of indexes |
| Persistence | Dropped at end of session/application | Dropped at end of session/transaction |
| Query Optimization | Uses Catalyst Optimizer, whole-stage code generation | Uses cost-based optimizer, index seeks |
| Data Distribution | Can be distributed across cluster | Typically on a single node |
| Partitioning | Supports partitioning for large datasets | May support partitioning (database-specific) |
| Caching | Can be explicitly cached for faster access | May use buffer pool for caching |
| Constraints | Does not support constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY) | Supports constraints |
| Triggers | Does not support triggers | Often supports triggers |
| Concurrency | Handled by Spark's concurrency model | Handled by RDBMS transaction management |
| Size Limitations | Limited by cluster resources | Often limited by temp space allocation |
| Creation Syntax | `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW` or `CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW` | Usually `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` |
| Language Support | SQL, Python, Scala, R | Primarily SQL |
| Join Performance | Optimized for distributed joins | Optimized for local joins, may use indexes |
| Update Operations | Immutable (changes create new version) | Mutable (in-place updates) |
| Automated Optimization | Features like AQE (Adaptive Query Execution) | Statistics-based optimization |
| Integration with Big Data | Native integration with big data ecosystems | Limited without additional tools |
| Streaming Support | Can be used with structured streaming | Generally not applicable |
| Scalability | Scales with cluster size | Limited to single node capacity |

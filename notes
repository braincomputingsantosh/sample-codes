import acs_data

Class: sequence_cache

Purpose: Caches sequence lookups for specific year and year_type combinations.

Attributes:

cols: Initially set to None
rs: Initially set to None (likely stands for "result set")
year: Initially set to None
year_type: Initially set to None

Methods:
a. init(self, db, year, year_type):

Initializes or updates the cache if the year or year_type has changed.
Logs the caching process.
Calls cache_seq(db) to populate the cache.

b. cache_seq(self, db):

Initializes self.rs as an empty dictionary.
Executes a SQL query to select distinct tbl and seq from census.dd_seq table.
Iterates through the query results:

Initializes and updates prev_seq to track changes in seq.
For each unique seq, creates a list in self.rs[seq] and appends tbl to it.



c. get_cols(self, seq: int):

Returns the cached columns for a given seq (sequence number).


SQL Query:

Selects distinct tbl and seq from census.dd_seq table.
Filters where tbl is not 'edt_file_id' and year matches the instance's year.

### custom_logic function

Performs custom logic operations on file data, likely for data processing or validation.
Parameters:

db: Database connection or object
foi: File Object Interface, containing metadata about the file
df: Dataframe or data object
logic_status: LogicState object to track the status of operations

Key Operations:

Extracts current file state from df
Defines a file name pattern using regex
Initializes rows_inserted counter
Retrieves parent_file_id and file_size from logic_status
Checks if file_size is 0, fails if true
Constructs full_file_path
Extracts metadata (table_name, target_schema, year, year_type, seq, basename) from file path and foi
Initializes sequence cache and retrieves column data
Sets up buffers (dff_buffer, dff_buffer_moe) and buffer_list_len
Calculates col_count
Constructs paths for 'e' and 'm' files

Data Reading and Processing:

Reads two CSV files ('e' and 'm') using pandas.read_csv()
Options used: no header, low_memory=False, dtype=object, engine='c'


Column Validation:

Checks if the number of columns in the dataframe matches the expected count
If mismatched, logs an error and fails the operation
If matched, sets the column names for both dataframes (dff and dff_moe)


Data Manipulation:

Applies year_type to both dataframes
Sets 'year' column in both dataframes
Drops specified columns from both dataframes


Data Buffering:

Calculates original size of the dataframe
Appends dataframes to respective buffers (dff_buffer and dff_buffer_moe)


Buffer Processing:

If buffer_list_len is 1, assigns the first element of buffers
Else, likely performs concatenation (code partially visible)


Data Transformation:

Uses pandas.melt() to reshape dff_buffer and dff_buffer_moe
Merges the melted dataframes (ee and ee_moe) using pandas.merge()


Buffer Reset:

Clears dff_buffer and dff_buffer_moe
Updates org_size with the length of ee_merged


Data Cleaning:

Removes rows with NaN values in both 'stat' and 'moe' columns
Calculates number of dropped rows (nan_dropped)
Logs a warning if any rows were dropped due to NaN values


Database Operations:

Attempts to bulk load the merged dataframe into the database
Logs the number of rows inserted
Sets status to 'PROCESSED' if successful


Exception Handling:

Catches any exceptions during the database operation
Logs the exception
Sets status to 'FAILED'
Updates logic_status and current_file_state accordingly


Database Update:

If successful, updates the logging.meta_source_files table with the file process state


Function Return:

Returns the logic_status object


Additional Function:

Defines a process() function (implementation not fully visible)
Asserts that foi is an instance of FOI

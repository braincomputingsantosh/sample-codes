I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important observation regarding the handling of our CSV data exports, particularly those involving columns with HTML content.

Upon review, it has been noted that the action_origin column in our data exports does not contain any HTML data. However, other columns do include HTML content. When these CSV files are opened in Excel, there's a noticeable issue where the HTML data seems to overlap across multiple columns. This issue can cause significant confusion and potentially lead to data misinterpretation.

This behavior, although unintended, is a result of how Excel processes and displays HTML content within CSV files. Unfortunately, this is by design in Excel and affects the way data is visualized, leading to potential inaccuracies in our data handling processes.

To mitigate this issue and ensure accurate data review and analysis, I recommend using Sublime Text to open and work with these CSV files instead of Excel. Sublime Text handles the separation of columns and the display of HTML content more efficiently, without the overlapping issue observed in Excel. This change will allow us to maintain the integrity of our data and ensure that our analyses are based on accurate and unaltered information.

For those unfamiliar with Sublime Text, it is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose. It offers a user-friendly interface and powerful features that make it an excellent tool for handling our data files.

I understand this adjustment may require a slight change in our current workflows, but I believe it will significantly enhance our data handling capabilities. I am here to assist with any questions or support you may need in making this transition. Additionally, if you require guidance on using Sublime Text, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your continued commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data integrity within our team.

*************************************

It seems that the issue is specifically happening for the date 2201-05-18, which is clearly an invalid date and way beyond what we would expect (looks like a typo for 2021-05-18). This is causing the date to exceed the 9999-12-31 limit when processed by workday_optimized.

Fix:

You need to handle such invalid dates more gracefully, perhaps by filtering them out or correcting them if possible.

Step-by-Step Fix:

	1.	Filter out invalid dates: Letâ€™s add a check in the query to only process valid dates. Dates beyond a reasonable limit (e.g., 2099-12-31) can be filtered out or handled as an error condition.
	2.	Correct the specific invalid date: If the issue is due to data entry mistakes, you can either correct it in the source data or handle it explicitly in the query.

Dear [Recipient],
I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to inquire about the current necessity of Service Catalog Products for our Databricks implementation.
Given the evolving nature of our infrastructure, I wanted to confirm if these products are still required for our setup. We are actively working on configuring Databricks, but I wanted to touch base on this specific aspect.
It's worth noting that we're in the process of setting up numerous services within Databricks, which is quite an extensive undertaking. In light of this, I'm seeking clarification on whether the Service Catalog Products should remain a priority in our configuration process.
Could you please provide some insight into:

The current relevance of Service Catalog Products for our Databricks environment
Any potential impact on our ongoing configuration efforts if we were to deprioritize these products

Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated as it will help us allocate our resources more effectively.
Thank you for your time and assistance.

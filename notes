Incorrect 'stat' values:

The user notes that 'stat' values are incorrect in some cases.
For total population (p1-0), the correct number of tracts is present, but the 'stat' values are wrong.
The census website shows the value should be 4,714, but the user's data shows 22.


Duplicate observations:

There are duplicate observations in the data.
A query for total housing units in DC should return only 1 observation, but it returns 3.


Incorrect tract counts:

For variable 'hct1-1', the correct number of observations for census tracts is not present.
The user should get 296,719 observations but only gets 27,632.


Mismatch in specific 'stat' values:

The user can't match the specific values of 'stat' for specific census tracts.


Inconsistent 'year_type' column:

The census.sf1 table has a column called 'year_type' with a value of 5.
This value only makes sense in the context of ACS (American Community Survey), not the decennial census.

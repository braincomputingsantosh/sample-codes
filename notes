Subject: Completed: Parameterization of ETL Processing Notebooks

Hi Team,

I've completed the parameterization of the ETL processing notebooks for our data pipeline. Here's a summary of the work completed:

1. Parameterized three Delta Table Update notebooks:
   - HELOC (mcdash_loan_identifier, as_of_month)
   - Loan Month (loan_id, as_of_month)
   - Loan Month Loss Mitigation (lps_loan_id, as_of_month)

2. Parameterized ETL Processor notebook for full load process
   - Handles multiple tables in a single run
   - Configurable source and target schemas

3. All notebooks now accept runtime parameters:
   - Database names
   - Table names
   - Metadata table location
   - Schema evolution enabled

4. Common parameters across notebooks:
   raw_table_name
   silver_table_name
   metadata_table_name
   raw_database
   silver_database

Job Parameters for each notebook have been documented and tested.

Enhanced Features Added:
- Detailed logging
- Error handling
- Success/Failure status tracking
- Processing summaries
- Schema validation
- Table existence checks

Next Steps:
- Review and approve changes
- Schedule jobs with appropriate parameters
- Monitor initial runs

Please let me know if you need any modifications or have questions.

Best regards,

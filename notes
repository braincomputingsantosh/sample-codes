Title: Temporary Tables in Databricks: Efficient Data Handling for Analytics and ETL

Introduction

Definition: Temporary tables in Databricks are volatile data structures used for intermediate data processing.
Purpose: Facilitate complex queries, data transformations, and improve query performance.


Types of Temporary Tables
a. Session-scoped Temporary Views

Visible only within the current Spark session
Created with: CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...
b. Global Temporary Views
Visible across all sessions within the same Spark application
Created with: CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...
Accessed via the global_temp database: SELECT * FROM global_temp.view_name


Key Characteristics

Lifetime: Exist for the duration of the session or Spark application
Storage: In-memory or disk-based, depending on size and configuration
Performance: Can be cached for faster access
Limitations: No support for indexes, constraints, or triggers


Use Cases

Intermediate results in complex ETL processes
Simplifying multi-step analytical queries
Temporary data sharing across notebooks in the same cluster
Optimizing performance for frequently accessed subsets of data


Advantages

Improved query performance for complex operations
Reduced data movement and I/O operations
Simplified code for multi-step data transformations
Facilitates modular and readable code structure


Considerations and Best Practices

Use for transient operations, not long-term storage
Drop views when no longer needed to free resources
Be mindful of data privacy in shared environments
Leverage caching for frequently accessed temp views
Use meaningful names to avoid conflicts


Comparison with Permanent Tables

Temp Tables: Faster for intermediate operations, session-scoped
Permanent Tables: Persistent storage, shareable across sessions and users


Integration with Databricks Features

Compatible with Delta Lake operations
Can be used in Databricks notebooks, jobs, and workflows
Useful in Structured Streaming for transformations


Performance Tips

Use appropriate partitioning for large datasets
Consider the Databricks Runtime version for optimal performance
Monitor usage with Spark UI and Databricks observability features


Conclusion

Temp tables are powerful tools for efficient data processing in Databricks
Balance usage between temp and permanent tables based on your use case
Proper use can significantly optimize your data workflows and query performance

This simulation demonstrates several important behaviors when multiple users work with the same global temporary view:

Visibility: Both users can see and query the same global temporary view.
Read Consistency: Both users see the same initial data when they query the view.
Isolation: When a user attempts to modify the data (by creating a new DataFrame with additional data), these changes are local to their session and do not affect the original global temporary view.
Immutability: The createOrReplaceGlobalTempView call doesn't actually modify the original view for other sessions. It creates a new view that's only visible within the current session.
Persistence of Original Data: The final state shows that the original global temporary view remains unchanged, regardless of the operations performed by individual users.

Key takeaways:

Global temporary views provide a read-only shared view of data across sessions.
Modifications made by one user do not affect what other users see.
There's no built-in mechanism for one user to update the global temporary view in a way that's immediately visible to other users.
To share modifications, users would need to create a new global temporary view or use a persistent table.

In practice, if you need shared, mutable data that multiple users can update and immediately see each other's changes, you should consider using:

Delta Lake tables, which provide ACID transactions and better support for concurrent operations.
Regular persistent tables with proper concurrency control mechanisms.
External systems designed for concurrent multi-user access, like traditional databases.

Global temporary views are best used for sharing read-only reference data or intermediate results within a Spark application, rather than for collaborative, mutable datasets.

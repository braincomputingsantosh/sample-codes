current_holidays CTE: Selects all regular holidays from the sv3_res.date_dimension table.
exception_days CTE: This is where you'll add the exceptional days. I've provided an example structure, but you'll need to populate this with your specific exceptional days.
total_holiday_table CTE: Combines the regular holidays and exceptional days using a UNION operation.
The final SELECT statement retrieves all rows from the total_holiday_table, giving you a complete list of all days that should not be counted as business days.

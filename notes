# Python Shapefile Data Processing

This repository contains scripts for processing and visualizing geospatial data from shapefiles using Python. The scripts demonstrate how to read data from shapefiles, store it in an SQLite database, and then visualize it using Folium.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   If you have git installed, you can clone the repository using:
```git clone [URL to the repository]```   

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the repository and extract it.

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd path/to/directory
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

On macOS and Linux:
```source venv/bin/activate```

Install Required Packages

Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install folium sqlite3 shapely
Note: sqlite3 is included in the standard Python library and does not need to be installed separately.

Running the Scripts
Prepare Your Shapefile

Ensure you have a shapefile (.shp file) ready for processing. Update the script(s) with the path to your shapefile.

Run the Script to Process Shapefile and Store in SQLite

bash
Copy code
python script_to_process_shapefile.py
Replace script_to_process_shapefile.py with the name of your Python script file that processes the shapefile and stores it in an SQLite database.

Run the Script to Visualize Data on a Map with Folium

bash
Copy code
python script_to_visualize_data.py
Replace script_to_visualize_data.py with the name of your Python script file that reads from the SQLite database and visualizes the data using Folium.

View the Map

After running the visualization script, an HTML file named map.html will be generated. Open this file in a web browser to view the map.

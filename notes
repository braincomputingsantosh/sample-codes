Based on the analysis of the messages, here are the recommended actions:

1. Create a Triage memo that outlines the plan to validate Bell Bank's corrective actions through ongoing monitoring.

2. Confirm the exact resubmission status for HMDA LARs for 2021, 2022, and 2023. Pay special attention to the 4/27/2024 submission, which may cover multiple years.

3. Request proof of resubmission directly from Bell Bank for all affected years, as this was the standard practice in previous monitoring.

4. Follow up with Muralidhar Malyala for any additional information they might provide about the resubmissions.

5. Document the limitations of the current HMDA Tool in tracking resubmissions, especially for recent years (2022 and 2023).

6. Propose improvements to the HMDA Tool to better track and display resubmission information for multiple years.

7. Ensure that the monitoring process includes a thorough review of all submissions and resubmissions, rather than simply accepting entity-provided proof without verification.

8. Coordinate with Craig Cameron to verify the resubmission details he has access to and incorporate this information into the final assessment.

9. Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the findings, including any discrepancies or uncertainties in the submission dates and content.

10. Develop a standardized process for handling similar FDIC referrals in the future, incorporating lessons learned from this case.

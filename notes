Subject: SF1 Data Loading Complete - Missing States Added and Geo Linkages Verified

Dear Team,

I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress with our census data project:

1. Missing States SF1 Data:
   - We've successfully loaded the SF1 (Summary File 1) data for all previously missing states into our Citus prod database.
   - This completes our SF1 dataset, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all U.S. states and territories.

2. Geo Data Linkage Verification:
   - We've thoroughly verified and validated the linkages between the SF1 data and the geographic data in the geo_sf1_2010 table.
   - All SF1 records now correctly correspond to their respective geographic entities.

Key Points:
- The SF1 dataset is now complete and fully integrated.
- Geographic linkages are accurate, allowing for precise spatial analysis and mapping.
- Query performance has been tested and optimized for the expanded dataset.

Next Steps:
- Update any relevant documentation or data dictionaries to reflect the complete dataset.
- Inform analytics teams that the full SF1 data is now available for use.
- Schedule a brief meeting to discuss any questions or potential use cases for the complete dataset.

If you have any questions or need further information about the data loading process or the linkage verification, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Step 3: Deploy Databricks Workspace

- **Choose Deployment Method**:
  - **Quick Start**: Use the Databricks AWS Quick Start for a simplified setup.
  - **AWS CloudFormation**: Utilize templates for customizable deployments.
- **Specify Parameters**: Input required details such as VPC ID, subnet IDs, and IAM roles.
- **Launch Stack**: Initiate the deployment and wait for the resources to be provisioned.

### Step 4: Access Databricks Workspace

- **Retrieve URL**: After deployment, obtain the workspace URL from the CloudFormation outputs.
- **Login**: Access the Databricks workspace and complete any initial setup steps.
- **Configure Workspace**: Set up users, groups, and cluster policies as needed.

## Databricks Task Required Parameters

When creating tasks or jobs in Databricks, certain parameters are required:

## How to Deploy Databricks Integration Using Service Catalog

AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services approved for use on AWS.

### Step 1: Create a Portfolio

- **Access Service Catalog**: Navigate to the AWS Service Catalog console.
- **Create Portfolio**: Define a new portfolio for Databricks deployments.
- **Set Permissions**: Assign IAM users, roles, or groups who can access the portfolio.

### Step 2: Add Databricks Product

- **Define Product**: Create a new product within the portfolio.
- **Upload Template**: Use a CloudFormation template provided by Databricks.
- **Configure Details**: Add product name, description, and owner information.

### Step 3: Configure Constraints and Parameters

- **Set Launch Constraints**: Define IAM roles for product provisioning.
- **Parameter Configuration**: Predefine parameter values and constraints for consistent deployments.

### Step 4: Share Portfolio

- **Share with Accounts**: If using multiple AWS accounts, share the portfolio accordingly.
- **Accept Portfolio**: In recipient accounts, accept the shared portfolio to make products available.

### Step 5: Provision the Product

- **Access Catalog**: Users navigate to the Service Catalog to view available products.
- **Launch Product**: Select the Databricks product and provide necessary parameters.
- **Review and Deploy**: Confirm settings and launch the deployment.

### Step 6: Manage Deployed Resources

- **Monitor Deployment**: Use CloudFormation stacks to track resource creation.
- **Access Workspace**: Once deployed, access the Databricks workspace using the provided URL.
- **Operational Management**: Manage clusters, jobs, and other resources within Databricks.

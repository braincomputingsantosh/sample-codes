Summary of Findings:

We received an FDIC referral letter noting potential HMDA and Regulation C violations at Bell Bank.
Bell Bank has reportedly corrected the errors, but we need to verify this.
We've identified submission dates for HMDA LARs:

2023: submitted on 2/27/2024
2022: submitted on 3/10/2023
2021: submitted on 3/2/2022 and 4/27/2024


There's uncertainty about whether the 4/27/2024 submission covers all years (2021-2023).
Our HMDA Tool has limitations in providing detailed information about recent resubmissions.
Our previous practice was to accept proof of resubmission from the entity without further verification.

Key Action Items:

Create a Triage memo for validating Bell Bank's corrective actions.
Confirm exact resubmission status for 2021-2023 HMDA LARs.
Request direct proof of resubmission from Bell Bank.
Document HMDA Tool limitations and propose improvements.
Develop a standardized process for handling FDIC referrals.

Given the complexity of this issue and the need for coordinated action, I suggest we schedule a meeting to discuss our next steps. Please let me know your availability for next week, and I'll arrange a time that works for everyone.
During this meeting, we can:

Review our findings in detail
Assign responsibilities for each action item
Discuss potential improvements to our monitoring process
Set deadlines for completion of each task

Please come prepared with any additional insights or concerns you may have.
